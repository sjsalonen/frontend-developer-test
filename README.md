# React frontend assignment

## Description

Your task is to implement a component or a set of components allowing the users to fetch and display change history of **users** and **projects** in separate tables according to the designs and requirements below. You can use the provided packages and add new ones if necessary. Please provide unit tests for your code.

## Requirements
- Handle the loading state
- Handle the error state (every second call to fetch users or projects will result in an error)
- Make sure the table can be browsed also on smaller screens
- By default table data should be sorted in reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Users should be able to sort by the **Date** column only and be able to toggle between reverse chronological and chronological order
- After fetching new entries, table should be re-sorted according to currently selected sorting order
